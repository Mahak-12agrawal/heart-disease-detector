# ❤️ Heart Disease Detector (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a simple Machine Learning project that predicts whether a person has heart disease or not using Logistic Regression.

The model is trained on sample medical data and performs binary classification:
- 1 → Heart Disease Detected
- 0 → No Heart Disease

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression

---

## 📊 Features Used
The model uses the following input features:
- Age
- Cholesterol Level
- Blood Pressure

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. A small dataset is created using sample medical data.
2. The data is divided into training and testing sets.
3. Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data.
4. The model predicts whether a new patient has heart disease.
5. Accuracy is calculated to evaluate performance.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook file.
2. Run all cells.
3. The model will train and display accuracy.
4. It will predict heart disease for a new patient.

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Use real-world medical dataset
- Add more health features
- Improve accuracy with advanced models
- Build a simple web interface
